I am currently working at Jarden as a developer in the Wealth Management Tribe, primarily focused on back end development in Python and Node TS using AWS Lambdas and traditional Kubernetes based microservices. 
I have always had a keen interest in using data and analytics to make better investment and design decisions. 

I take pride in my knowledge of the domain and use it to make better design and architecture decisions when writing code, doing data analysis, and helping my team to deliver business value.
My team leaned on my analytical background and domain knowledge often to detail requirements, user stories, and crunch data sets and reconciliations when it was needed with a combination of SQL, Python, and Excel.

After pivoting from Actuarial Science to be a developer I fostered a passion for functional programming, treating my code like algebraic equations with specific inputs, piping and composing functions.
It came much more naturally to me than the OOP I had learned at university, I could imagine the solution in my mind, visualising my code, step by step, before implementing it.
I combined my passion for FP and long term investing in my library [investment-simulator](https://github.com/SidGanesan/investment-simulator), implementing Modern Portfolio Theory and Monte Carlo simulations to optimise portfolios of ETFs to diversify risk, improve returns programmatically and visualise the effect of different allocations.

I am passionate about software architecture and design in my day-to-day work, always considering the separation of concerns in the services I develop and how they integrate within the wider microservice landscape.

Lastly I am a big proponent for mental health, especially for students, having organised the first ever welfare day in conjunction with the mental health foundation, at Victoria University’s’ Pipitea Campus as part of my duties at the Victoria University of Wellington Commerce Students Society. 

Thank you very much for your time, I look forward to hearing from you in the near future.
