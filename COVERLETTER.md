I am currently working at Jarden as a developer in the Wealth Management Tribe primarily focused on back end development in Python and Node TS using AWS Lambdas and traditional Kubernetes based microservices. 
As part of the wealth tribe I have helped to deliver, tax reporting, portfolio management, order and trade services, bulk ordering, and compliance monitoring. 

I have always had a keen interest in using data and analytics to make better investment decisions.
I take pride in my knowledge of the domain and use it to make better design decisions when writing code, doing data analysis, and helping my team to deliver business value.
My team leaned on my analytical background and domain knowledge often to detail requirements, user stories, and crunch data sets and reconciliations when it was needed with a combination of SQl, Python, and Excel.

After pivoting learning to be a developer I fostered a passion for functional programming, treating my code like algebraic equations with specific inputs and outputs.
It came much more naturally to me than the OOP I had learned at university, I could imagine the solution in my mind, visualising my code, step by step, piping and composing functions before implementing it.
I combined my passion for FP and investing in my library [investment-simulator](https://github.com/SidGanesan/investment-simulator), implemented Modern Portfolio Theory and Monte Carlo simulations to optimise portfolios of ETFs to diversify risk, improve returns programmatically and visualise the effect of different allocations.

Lastly I am a big proponent for mental health, especially for students, having organised the first ever welfare day in conjunction with the mental health foundation, at Victoria University’s’ Pipitea Campus as part of my duties at the Victoria University of Wellington Commerce Students Society. 

Thank you very much for your time, I look forward to hearing from you in the near future.
